# Introduction #

If we could design the perfect production line, what would it look like? What if you thought about industry from a top level ‘systems perspective’? To generalize, lets say we want a production line that takes nothing to run and produces anything you want. We would want it to make all of its own spare parts and consume no outside resources. We would want it not to produce any waste out of the machine for us to deal with. We would like it to be kept up to date with the latest processes automatically and with no cost to get this update. It should let anyone come up with their own things for it to make, and produce them with no change to the production line. Sounds like something you might like to have, or have access to?

Thinking about problems in this way is the mindset of followers of a new group from the maker movement, called Technocopianism. They (myself among them) believe that this way of producing things, built through open-source projects, is the way we should begin to think about industry. The first wave of this sort of technology has begun to be designed with the 3d printer explosion. Thanks to some recent discoveries in materials science, and the opening and indexing of academic research into the open-source community, we can now lay out a framework of what open source industry might look like when we are finished designing it.

Lets begin with a thought experiment. Imagine a building, lets say 1000 ft/square with 12 ft ceilings. In this space you have a machine, this machine takes in air and energy and can make things like food, water purifiers, air wells, composite fiberboard, manufactured plastics, electronics, computers, solar panels, LED's even electric vehicles. Some things need to be put together like Ikea furniture, some are assembled. Nothing is made using metals or minerals, but there is no need for them either. This machine will also produce enough food for one person permanently.

Now the neatest trick this thing will do is make an exact copy of itself as well as the other things. This means if you need more stuff then the machine can provide, you make another one. In fact, since there is no cost and very little labor to build new ones, you generally would keep a spare ready to go, just in case. These machines can be kept individually, or in your local community center to encourage communal meals and collaborative inventing and creativity.

Inside the machine on one end is a small vertical aquaponics farm where the veggies, fish and raw material for the rest of the industrial processes comes from. The materials digesters turn biomass into plastics, graphene electronics and semiconductors, and a whole host of composites. Next level is the fixtureless manufacturing, of which 3d printing is one part. Robotics manages the interactions between the stages, take care of the plants and doles out the ordered items. You use one of the computers made by the machine to design new things, upload them to the internet to share with everyone with a similar machine, and ultimately print out on their local manufacturing system.=Additional Material=
